-This site is intended to be used for when someone is having a seizure, they would have a QR code, on a card, bag, etc that would send you to the website. 
<br><br>
-The site is made for cellphones, and has 2 boxes, 1 for information you would want to give, and the other for anything else (curentally has buttons that call phone numbers).
<br><br>
-There is also a timer at the bottom that auto starts when the user enters the site the allows them to track how long the person has been in a seizure - it has a time alert for if they have medication or to call help if it lasts a certain time.

-you are able to customise this site to have/fit what you want
